        <p>This is a site about apes and gorillas. In fact it's a site about primates and CSS. If you had enough primates, all working together, they would produce pretty good style sheets. Maybe.</p>

      <section class="main-content">
        <p>When Jane Goodall first witnessed Gombe chimpanzee David Greybeard fishing for termites by manipulating blades of grass in 1960, the line between humans and other animals suddenly became blurry. Tool use was no longer uniquely human, leading Dr. Louis Leakey, Jane’s mentor, to famously say, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.”
          We know that chimpanzees are our closest cousins in the animal kingdom, sharing 98.6% of our DNA. Chimpanzees are also known to exhibit remarkably human-like behaviors, such as grieving over the loss of a loved one, generating strategies to thrive in social groups, and even learning sign language.  </p>

        <p>But what allows us to share these things in common? Is it our brain structure, our shared genetic similarities, or our cultures? Turns out, it’s a mix of many things! </p>


        <p>To start, it’s important to understand the chimpanzee “fission-fusion” social system. In this system, there are communities of up to 100 individuals that occasionally come together to eat, socialize, and mate, but spend most of their time in tighter sub-groups.  Early human communities are thought to have lived in similar groups</p>

        <p>Strong alliances, bonds, and intrasexual dominance hierarchies between members make up most of the social dynamics in chimpanzee groups. Through these hierarchies, members of the same sex compete for access to resources such reproductive mates or food, resulting in alpha males and alpha females. Studies of human culture lead us to believe that we too operate with intrasexual hierarchies – just think about the famous myths in which men compete for the heart of a woman to become king!  </p>

        <p>Although males are dominant overall in chimpanzee groups, the most important relationships are between mothers and their dependent offspring, which we know largely thanks to studies initiated by Jane in the early 1960s. Chimpanzees learn essential life skills from their mothers, including how to pick up on emotional cues, be a good leader, and demonstrate compassion.

          <p>Flo and Gremlin, for example, are two popular and outstanding chimpanzee mothers from Gombe. Gremlin persevered through the hard task of raising twins in the wild, and two of Flo’s sons grew up to become alpha males. Together, they showcase the importance of a strong mother-infant relationship – something humans need as well. </p>

              <img src="images/th/th-image-11.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Together with humans, gorillas, and orangutans they are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes, or hominids). Native to sub-Saharan Africa, common chimpanzees and bonobos are currently both found in the Congo jungle, while only the common chimpanzee is also found further north in West Africa. Both species are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and in 2017 the Convention on Migratory Species selected the common chimpanzee for special protection. </p>

              <p> Gibbons are apes in the family Hylobatidae. The family historically contained one genus, but now is split into four genera and 18 species. Gibbons live in tropical and subtropical rain forests from eastern Bangladesh and northeast India to southern China and Indonesia (including the islands of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java). Also called the lesser apes or smaller apes, gibbons differ from great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans and humans) in being smaller, exhibiting low sexual... </p>

              <p>The Vervet Monkey is an Old World classification. There are 5 known subspecies that have been identified. They have a very unique appearance to them which helps them to be separated from other types of Monkeys found in the world. In addition to behavioral research on natural populations, vervet monkeys serve as a nonhuman primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans. They have been noted for having human-like characteristics, such as hypertension, anxiety, and... </p>

              <p>Marmosets (species of Callithrix, Cebuella, Callibella, and Mico) are the smallest monkeys and live in the upper canopy of trees. Marmosets are just 5 inches tall and are highly active. They are mostly found in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil. They feed on insects, fruits and leaves. Long lower incisors enable marmosets to chew the tree trunks and branches and extract gum. For communication, they whistle or make high-pitched noises that are inaudible to humans. Don't go by its size as the male...</p>

              <p>Tamarins (genus Saguinus) are the inhabitants of the tropical rainforests, mainly found in Brazil. They can be differentiated because their body color usually ranges from shades of black, brown, white and bright orange. The Tamarins with brown and white fur are “emperor tamarins” and ones with bright orange fur are called “golden lion tamarins”. The tamarin’s lower canine teeth are longer than the incisors. They are omnivorous. Their body size ranges from 13 to 30 cm and in captivity, they can live up to 18 years. </p>

              <p>Spider monkeys (genus Ateles) are well-known for their jungle acrobats. They are native to tropical forests of South and Central America and are one of the few species of monkeys that are endangered species. They have long limbs that are out of proportion along with prehensile tails, making them one of the largest among the New World primates. They are brown and black in color with a long tail. These monkeys have a diet consisting of fruits, flowers and leaves. The female, generally, hunts for food, but if she can’t get sufficient amount, then the group splits into smaller sections that spread out to hunt for more. Spider monkeys have this strange..</p>

              <p>Squirrel monkeys (genus Saimiri) are mostly found in Central and South American forests. They are 25 to 35 cm tall and live in the canopy layer of the trees. They have short and close fur. Their backs and extremities are yellowish orange, whereas the shoulders are olive-colored. Squirrel monkeys have black and white face. They have hair on the upper side of the head. These monkeys are timid and silent. They are always found in large groups comprising 100-300 individuals. Being omnivores they primarily feed on fruits and insects, while occasionally eating nuts, eggs, seeds, leaves, flowers, etc. </p>
